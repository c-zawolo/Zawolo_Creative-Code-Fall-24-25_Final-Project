    <p>What a semester. It’s easy to let it fly by when you’re trying to keep your head above water. With the end comes the culmination of my time in Introduction to Creative Code. It’s provided me many lessons, but the one I’ve chosen to bake into the essence of this final work is a desire to continue playing. To continue pursuing the joy that landed me where I am, and provided me the chance to take this class. Something that doesn’t fade or falter. In times of peace, anguish, excitement, and disappointment. The urge to draw and create has always been a part of me. And so, whoever may find themselves reading this, revel in that simple joy. That is all I ask of you.
